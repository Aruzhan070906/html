    Yoo Shi Jin and Kang Mo Yeon felt mutual sympathy for each other from the first chance meeting. He is a member of the UN peacekeeping force, she is a doctor who spends 12 hours in the operating room. But they never managed to start a relationship: due to their busy schedules, they only managed to go on one date, and from then on, Yu Shi Jin was called to duty. Kang Mo Yeon realized quite quickly: if a helicopter comes for a person, this is an unusual soldierâ€™s service, which means that Yu Shi Jin constantly risks his life, and he himself is also forced to kill people, which is unthinkable for a doctor. Realizing how different their views on life are, Kang Mo Yeon suggests that Yoo Shi Jin break up. However, soon fate brings them together again: Kang Mo-yeon is sent at the head of a group of volunteer doctors to a hot spot in Uruk. Yu Shi Jin is detachment was recently redeployed here. In this hot country they will face a variety of dangers, and perhaps look at each other differently.
